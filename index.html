      <p>A page dedicated to Victorian birds and birders.</p>
      <h2>350+ Big Year List</h2>
      <p>
        For the sake of standardising Victorian Big Year totals, this list follows IOC taxonomy where possible.
        Species included on lists must be seen or heard in the wild in Victoria, part of an established wild population and wild-born.
        Vagrant species are accepted provided that there is sufficient reason to believe they are not escaped captive birds.
        Introduced species are accepted where the invasive population is well established in the state over multiple generations.
        Pelagic species are accepted, following VORAC guidelines for the extension of borders.
        Captive-released birds introduced into a wild population (i.e. non-wild-born Orange-bellied Parrot, Regent Honeyeater) are not accepted in official tallies but are listed in notes.
        Introduced species of questionable origin (i.e. Mallard, Red-whiskered Bulbul) are also included in adjusted numbers but not on official tallies.
        Where an official list has been provided in IOC taxonomy and standardised to the above requirements, a check mark is included beside the count.
        This list makes no attempt to absolutely verify sightings, as birding ultimately operates on an honour system.
        Dubious lists are only removed from the rankings where there is a body of evidence to suggest falsification of sightings.
        As such, just because a list is provided and standardised (✔️), it does not mean all sightings are verified.
